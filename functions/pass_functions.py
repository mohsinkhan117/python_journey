'''
The pass statement in Python is a placeholder that does nothing when executed.

It is used to keep code blocks valid where a statement is required but no logic is needed yet.
Examples situations where pass is used are empty functions, classes, loops or conditional blocks.
In Functions
The pass keyword in a function is used when we define a function but don't want to implement its 
logic immediately. It allows the function to be syntactically valid, even though it doesn't perform any actions yet.
'''

# As python is an interpreted language, so we need to must execute any statement at
# each line, pass is the statement which we can use for no execution
def fun():
    pass

fun() # Call the function
#Explanation: fun() is defined but contains pass statement, so it does nothing when called and program continues execution without any errors.


'''
In Conditional Statements
In conditional statements, when no action is needed but a block is still required, pass statement acts as a 
placeholder to keep the code syntactically valid.'''

x = 10

if x > 5:
    pass  # Placeholder for future logic
else:
    print("x is 5 or less")

'''In Loops
In loops, pass can be used to skip writing any action during a specific
 iteration while still keeping the loop structure correct.'''

for i in range(5):
    if i == 3:
        pass  # Do nothing when i is 3
    else:
        print(i)


'''In Classes
The pass statement allows defining empty classes or
 methods that act as placeholders until actual functionality is added later.'''

class EmptyClass:
    pass  # No methods or attributes yet

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
    
    def greet(self):
        pass  # Placeholder for greet method

# Creating an instance of the class
p = Person("Emily", 30)
